## How to

Cook your ramen noodles in a pot for 5-6 minutes (or until they are soft), strain the water and wash them with cold water twice (to stop the cooking process), then let them rest - we won't need them until plating.

Lightly wash the chicken thighs and put them in a large metal pot.
Slice your carrots, ginger, onion and chilli pepper - toss it all in the pot.
Cut your garlic heads in half (there is no need to clean the cloves), and throw all 4 halves in the pot.

Add 4 large spoons of soy sauce to the pot, a sprinkle of kosher salt (just a bit) and cinnamon. Add the ground black pepper to taste.
Add a tablespoon of brown sugar.

Pour enough hot water to cover all the ingredients in the pot, close the lid and simmer on low to medium heat for at least 3 hours (recommended is 5 hours).

After your broth is looking golden-brown, take the chicken thighs out and freeze them (you can use them in a different meal, they taste great).

Take the vegetables out as well, then strain your broth into a bowl (we just want the liquid, nothing else).

Put the bowl aside and move on to our chicken.

Clean your chicken and slice it into 3 to 4 inch slices, (1/2 inch thick). Take a bowl and cover your chicken slices in 5-6 spoons of soy sauce, 3 spoons of honey and a tiny bit of tap water (just a tiny bit).

Rub the marinade into the slices and prepare a pan with 2 tablespoons canola oil on high heat. Drop your chicken slices in the pan and cover with a lid. After 2 minutes flip them over and cover the pan for 2 more minutes (our goal here is to have them seared on the outside but only 80% cooked on the inside).

Take the slices out, let them rest for at least 10 minutes and then slice them to bite sized slices (inch long, 1/2 inch thick).

Take a pot and put it over low-medium heat, pour our broth into it and let it simmer for 3-5 minutes. Once it is lightly bubbling, put your bite-sized chicken slices inside, and let them absorb all the flavor of the broth for a 3-5 minutes, then turn the heat off.

In the meantime, prepare 4 cups of boiling water, a bowl of cold ice water, and a small pot over medium-high heat. Pour the boiling water into the small pot and make sure it is bubbling. Carefully place 4 eggs in the water for _exactly_ 6.5 minutes (time it). Once the timer goes off, carefully take your eggs out (using a spoon!), place them in the ice water bowl, let them rest for a minute and then peel them (carefully, they are still soft inside).

# Plating

Take a deep soup bowl, pour our chicken broth with some chicken slices up to 60% of the bowl's capacity.
Add a handful of ramen noodles into the bowl.
Place 3-4 more chicken slices on top, next to the noodles. Take a soft egg and _carefuly_ slice it into halves and place them next to the chicken (sunny side up). Garnish with parsley and sesame seeds, you're done.
